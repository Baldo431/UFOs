# **UFOs**

## **Overview**


### Purpose
Utilize the data provided to present a mock article on UFO sightings online. The webpage must include a table of data to support the article findings along with filters that would allow a user to fine tune the table results to their liking. 
<br><br>

## **Results**
The table featured in the webpage is able to be filtered. To achieve this the user must:
1. Enter the text they would like to search for in one of the input boxes (See 1. in Figure 1). 
    - Note that only the first five columns in the table are able to be searched (See 2. in Figure 1). 
2. Once the desired text has been entered the user can apply the filter by changing the focus out of the input box (e.g., clicking outside of the input box). Additionally, pressing the "Enter" key while within the input box and after text has been entered may also be used to apply the filter. Figure 2 shows an example of what the webpage looks like once a filtered has been applied.
3. To apply a new filter the old search text must be erased or replaced. Alternatviely, the "UFO Sightings" link in the navbar may be clicked to reset the whole webpage.

## **Summary**
Drawbacks of this webpage:
- There is no clear controls (e.g., button) that allow the user to apply the filter when they choose to do so.
- Filters can't be applied to all available fields.
- Input has to be manually deleted when entering a new filter set after one has already been applied.
<br><br>

Additional recommendations for further development:
- Add a reset filter button to clear all the input in text boxes and reset the data in the table.
- Add sorting options for columns.
